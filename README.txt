## Introduction
The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of various GAN architectures in generating realistic human faces. The CelebA dataset, which contains over 200,000 celebrity images with 40 attribute annotations, is used for training and evaluating the models.

The GANs tested in this project include:
* Vanilla GAN
* Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
* Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
* Progressive Growing of GANs (ProGAN)
* StyleGAN
